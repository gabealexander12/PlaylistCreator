Role of submitting team member: Test Engineer 2

Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
Created the PlaylistTestSuite.java JUnit test class, which has the base methods and a summary of what each method will test. Provided feedback on some of the
logistical issues we were facing with the class names.

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
Continued to write the test methods for the application, but ran into a few obstacles, as not all methods that were decided to be tested are written in the front or 
back end. Continued to advise teammates on best way to integrate all of the code.

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
Made final edits to the test suite, added into the virtual machine, and created the flipgrid video.

Files written by me:
--------------------
PlaylistTestSuite.java (renamed to file below)
TestSuitePlaylist.java

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CS400Graph.java

Web address at which the program is available:
----------------------------------------------
<If you and your team have written a web app that is available on the internet,
replace this text with its address. This is not a requirement of Project Four
and you will not loose points for not implementing a web application or for not
having a running version on the web.>

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
My VM is acting weird, as it would not find the test suite for the longest time, but at the time of final submission, it does find it.
