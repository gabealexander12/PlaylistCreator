Contributions Week 1:

Uploaded a test CSV containing song data (playlist.csv)
Created the skeleton Data Wrangling Code (PlaylistWrangle.java)
Made a Song object class that contains getters/setters for the song data (Song.java)

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
Updated the song file, specifically added the toString() method (Song.java)
Filled in the readCSV method with the necessary code to add the data from the .csv to the Hashtable (PlaylistWrangle.java)
Added a resetSong method which removes all of the song's identifying characteristics/data (PlaylistWrangle.java)

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
Altered the Song.java file to work successfully with the BackEndFinalProject.java file
by updating constructor, class variables, and get/set methods (Song.java)
Updated PlaylistWrangle.java file's calls to the Song class since Song.java constructors
were altered (PlaylistWrangle.java)
Renamed my playlist.csv to music.csv to match FrontEnd.java and PlaylistTestSuite.java (music.csv)
Updated the PlaylistTestSuite.java file to match the music.csv that I have 
in this folder (PlaylistTestSuite.java (NOT MY FILE))
