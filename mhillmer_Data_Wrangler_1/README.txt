Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
Created a Skeleton outline of wrangle file(only created methods for fields that we are certain of at the time; artist, duration, name, genre, year) and an object class for the song to be added to the hast table. Also provided a sample CSV so the team has an idea of fields that are available. Basic comments and headers in object class nad wrangle class. 

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
Reworked and trimmed the CSV to include the data we wanted(added in song names, removed unwanted data, removed any songs with a missing field, added a toString()). Reworked and finished comments on the Song Object class(added a few fields and removed others). Finished coding and added comments to the data wrangle class(worked on deliemter and added the getters and setters for new fields). Created a small tester to show the wrangle code works properly(tests user input and the csv input). 

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
Found a bug with the CSV file and had to remove a bad song object. Updated my Wrangle file to fix a signle character bug. Finished comments on Wrangle file. Updated Make file. Reworked the built in tester for wrangle and debugged code.

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
CSV file was found online from a Github Repository. I edited the file to remove any object that had a blank field and removed un wanted fields. cleaned the file up to around 2500 songs from 20000 and made sure all songs were not dups.
